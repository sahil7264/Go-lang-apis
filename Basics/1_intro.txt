About GO lang : 
A procedural programming language is a type of programming language that uses procedures or functions to perform 
tasks and organize code in a sequential and modular manner.
Go is a statically typed (type declare before use) , concurrent, and garbage-collected programming language created at Google in 2009
Go is known for its support for concurrency, which is the ability to run multiple tasks simultaneously. 
Concurrency is achieved in Go through the use of Goroutines and Channels, which allow you to write code that 
can run multiple operations at the same time

Here are some key features of Go:
1) Simplicity: Go is designed to be easy to learn and use. Its syntax is simple and straightforward, making it a good choice for beginners and experienced programmers alike.
2) Concurrency: Go has built-in support for concurrency, allowing developers to write efficient and scalable code for multicore and distributed systems.
3) Garbage collection: Go has automatic memory management, which frees developers from having to worry about memory allocation and deallocation.
4) Fast compile times: Go has a fast compiler, which makes it easy to iterate quickly during development.
5) Cross-platform support: Go can be compiled to run on many different platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS.
6) Strong typing: Go is a statically typed language, which helps catch errors at compile time rather than at runtime.
7) Go has a large and growing community of developers and is used by many well-known companies, including Google, Uber, and Dropbox.

Here are some important points to keep in mind about Go programming language:
1) Go is a statically typed language, which means that the type of a variable must be declared before it can be used.
2) Go has a built-in garbage collector that automatically frees up memory when it is no longer needed.
3) Go has strong support for concurrency, allowing developers to write efficient and scalable code for multicore and distributed systems.
4) Go has a minimalist syntax that is easy to learn and read.
5) Go has a fast compiler that generates code that is optimized for modern hardware architectures.
6) Go has a standard library that provides support for a wide range of functionality, including networking, encryption, and file handling.
7) Go has a growing community of developers and a vibrant ecosystem of third-party packages and tools.
8) Go is used by many well-known companies for building large-scale distributed systems and high-performance applications.
Overall, Go is a powerful and efficient programming language that is well-suited for building modern applications and distributed systems. 
Its strong support for concurrency and minimalist syntax make it an attractive choice for developers who want to build scalable and efficient applications.

*Some important points*
1) Compiled / Interpreted -> Go is compiled , no jdm required
2) Go tool can run file directly without VM
3) executables are different

1) Use in system apps to web apps
2) Mindset is different from other language 
3) Object Oriented -> Yes or no 
4) Understand by just looking at the code 
5) Lot is miss in language 
6) no try catch , lexer is there


Lexer : 
Officially by Grammar use ';'
But lexer can do it simple
Lexer usually not put after )}

Types :
1) Case Sensitive
2) Everything is Type
3) String, Bool , Floating , Complex , Integer
